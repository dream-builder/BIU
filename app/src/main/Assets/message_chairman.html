    <em>Assalamu &lsquo;Alaykum Wa-rahmatullahi Wa-barakatuhu,</em><br /></p>

    <p>And very good day to all of you. May you be well throughout the year. I am pleased to welcome you all to our BIU website.</p>
  <p>Islam is the comprehensive system of life. It offers legitimate   rights to both man and woman to acquire knowledge from cradle to grave.   Moreover, it is the obligation of a state to make arrangements for the   education of every individual irrespective of gender, race, caste and   creed. Alhamdulillah, our BIU is one of these arrangements.</p>
  <p>Bangladesh Islami University (BIU) is a private university launched   in 2005 in Dhaka. Since establishment, BIU has been facing so many   challenges both internal and external. Nevertheless, BIU is one of the   top renowned private universities in Bangladesh.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>BIU&rsquo;s Vision: The University authority firmly aims at disseminating   holistic and modern education through integrated learning and   state-of-the-art training method. The authority strives to produce   professionals with self-confidence, versatile skills and ethical   standard to meet the challenges of the contemporary world and sow the   seeds of economic, spiritual and cultural growth.</li>
    <li>BIU&rsquo;s Mission: The mission of BIU is to impart education to   interweave the two educational streams-religious and modern in the light   of Islam. The Supreme Reality, Allah the Almighty, Who wants spiritual   consciousness, gives freedom to human intellect and imagination. There   are four sources of knowledge that are used in propounding the basic   concepts of a human being and his or her relationship with Allah S.W.T.   and the rest of the universes. These sources are; Revelation,   Intelligence, Reason and Consciousness.</li>
    <li>BIU&rsquo;s Goal: To inculcate the young men and women with the universal   principles of Tawheed (the Oneness of Allah S.W.T.). To make practical   steps for the moral, intellectual, economic, social, scientific and   technological development in accordance with the principles of Islam and   to take appropriate steps in finding out practical solutions to the   problems of the new millennium. In-Shaa-Allah BIU&rsquo;s authority is   confident that they will be able to reach their goal.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Â </p>
  <p>I expect that the students, teachers and officials of BIU will try   their best to fulfill the hopes and aspirations of our nation by   creating skilled manpower and future leaders.</p>
  <p>Let us pray to Almighty Allah S.W.T. for accepting all our ibaadah   and efforts and grant us peace, prosperity, progress, and above all, the   tawfique to continue to serve humanity with all the means. May Allah   S.W.T. be our constant Guide and Protector at all times. Aameen.</p>
  <p>Thank you all &amp; Wassalam.</p>
