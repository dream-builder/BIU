        <p><strong>TEACHING SYSTEM  </strong><br>
            The education system of BIU is typically a North American Model in the   fields of Business Administration, Computer Science and Information   Technology, UK model in the fields of Law and English and Saudi Arabian   Islamic Universities and Al-Azhar University model in the Faculty of   Islamic Studies &amp; Shari`ah. The University is a study laboratory for   the young learners who seek to excel in their chosen fields of   specialization.</p>
        <p><strong>THE CURRICULUM</strong><br>
            While designing the curriculum, the University followed the principles   as suggested by the Sixth International Islamic Conference held at Cape   Town, South Africa in 1996. The University has designed the curriculum   in such a manner that it leads to the shaping of a man/woman so that   he/she becomes spiritual, sound, creative, hard-working,   liberally-educated, environmentally aware of socio-political and   cultural phenomena and thus he/she becomes an integrated human being.</p>
        <p><strong>MEDIUM OF INSTRUCTION</strong><br>
            English/Arabic is the medium of instruction, which is indispensable to   follow the curriculum and the prescribed texts. Courses on English are   incorporated into the curriculum.  To raise the student&rsquo;s proficiency in   English, a number of English courses are administered concurrently with   regular course work.</p>
        <p><strong>FACULTY MEMBERS</strong><br>
            Faculty members of BIU are a selected group of teachers, researchers,   professionals and practitioners with proven records of excellence in   their respective fields. In addition to the services of its full time   faculty members, the university has access to a guide network of   academics from home and abroad in various fields, who can be   commissioned depending on necessity and convenience.</p>
        <p><strong>EXCHANGE/LINK PROGRAM AND CREDIT TRANSFER</strong><br>
            As the part of exchange program, recently, BIU has accomplished a   Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with International Islamic University,   Malaysia (IIUM) for the greater interests of both teachers and students   for their higher studies. Besides, BIU has the plan to develop exchange   programs with leading universities in North America, the U.K,   Australia, Egypt, Spain and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Such programs will   facilitate the exchange of faculty members and students. Besides   receiving teaching services of overseas faculty members, the students   may get themselves admitted for higher education to those universities   through credit transfer and get employment opportunities abroad   subsequently. BIU has the provision of accepting students from other   recognized universities for admission both at graduate and undergraduate   levels through credit transfer.</p>
